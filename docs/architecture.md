# Architecture

This document outlines the technical architecture and design decisions for the ghcpdemo project.

## Project Overview

ghcpdemo is designed as a demonstration repository for GitHub Copilot's coding agent capabilities. The architecture is intentionally simple and focused on showcasing AI-assisted development workflows.

## Design Principles

### 1. Simplicity First
- Minimal complexity to focus on demonstration purposes
- Clear, readable code structure
- Straightforward documentation

### 2. Documentation-Driven
- Comprehensive documentation as a core component
- Self-documenting code practices
- Clear examples and use cases

### 3. Extensibility
- Modular structure that allows for easy expansion
- Clear separation of concerns
- Well-defined interfaces for future enhancements

## Directory Structure

```

├── docs/                    # Documentation hub
│   ├── README.md           # Main documentation entry point
│   ├── getting-started.md  # User onboarding guide
│   ├── architecture.md     # This document
│   └── contributing.md     # Development guidelines
├── README.md               # Project summary and quick links
└── .gitignore             # Standard .NET project ignores
```

## Technology Stack

Currently, the project uses:
- **Markdown** - For documentation
- **Git** - Version control
- **GitHub** - Repository hosting and collaboration

Future additions may include:
- Programming languages (to be determined based on demonstration needs)
- Build systems and CI/CD pipelines
- Testing frameworks
- Development tools and utilities

## Architecture Decisions

### Documentation Structure
- Centralized documentation in the `docs/` directory
- Markdown format for universal readability
- Hierarchical organization with clear navigation

### Version Control Strategy
- Git-based workflow
- Feature branch development
- Pull request-based collaboration

## Scalability Considerations

The current architecture supports:
- Adding new documentation sections
- Introducing code components
- Expanding to multiple programming languages
- Integration with various development tools

## Security Considerations

- Standard Git security practices
- Public repository with appropriate content filtering
- No sensitive information in documentation or code

## Future Enhancements

Planned architectural improvements:
- Code examples and demonstrations
- Automated testing infrastructure
- Continuous integration pipelines
- Interactive documentation features
